# Feature-Selection-Codes-in-R-
This repository contains the code and data for the research study titled "Evaluating the Consistency of Model-Agnostic Feature Selection Techniques in Software Engineering". The study focuses on comparing the consistency of model-agnostic feature selection (FS) techniques with traditional methods across various datasets in the domains of Software Fault Prediction (SFP) and Software Development Effort Estimation (SDEE).
Features
Model-Agnostic FS Techniques: Implementation of Permutation Feature Importance (PFI).
Traditional FS Techniques: Examples include Linear Regression (LR) and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
Dataset Modifications: Procedures for dataset augmentation and reduction.
Validation Methods: Code for 3-fold, 5-fold, Leave-One-Out (LOO), and Bootstrap validations.
Consistency Measurement: Tools for calculating feature selection consistency.
